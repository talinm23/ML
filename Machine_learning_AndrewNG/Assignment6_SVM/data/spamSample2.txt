Overshare but feel free to keep your real name to yourself
Some social media puts all your information out there for everyone to see. Reddit lets you overshare without revealing your real name or identity.


Reddit communities take on the personality of their members
Every Reddit community is different-some require peer reviewed research, some exist only for the lols. To get a sense of what’s what, check out a community’s rules. Reddit may seem like a remnant of the wild west of the internet at times, but in reality, there are quite a few rules that everyone is expected to follow. Most rules are common sense, but if you’re not sure, check out our site-wide rules.
In addition to site-wide rules, each community also has its own set of rules that reflect its culture. Check them out to learn more about a community and what is and isn’t allowed.

Cheers,
