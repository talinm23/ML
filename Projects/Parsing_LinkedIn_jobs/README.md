#### Project overview:

In this project, we search for jobs and ask Openai to summarize and organize the contents and information of each job post so that we spend less time skimming through each job posting. 
This saves a lot of time and a decision whether to apply to the job or not is made much quicker (e.g. 5 seconds vs. 30 seconds). 
The output still needs some work in regards to the presentaiton of the results.
