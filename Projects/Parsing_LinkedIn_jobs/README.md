#### Project overview:

In this project, we search for jobs and ask Openai to summarize and organize the contents and information of each job description so that we spend less time skimming through the job posting. 
This saves a lot of time and a decision whether to apply to the job or not is made quicker (e.g. 5 seconds vs. 30 seconds). 
The output still needs some work in regards to the presentaiton of the results.
