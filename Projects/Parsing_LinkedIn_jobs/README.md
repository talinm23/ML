#### Project overview:

In this project, we search for Data Scientist jobs and use OpenAI to summarize and organize the contents of each job posting. This approach helps save time by reducing the need to skim through each posting in detail. As a result, the idea is that decisions about whether to apply for a job can be made much faster (e.g., 5 seconds versus 30 seconds). However, the output still requires improvement in terms of presentation. Right now the output comes in the form of a csv file (e.g. table.csv shared here). The next step is to add the links of the jobs as well as existing or additional summarized information in the csv as well.
