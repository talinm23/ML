#### Project overview:

In this project, we search for jobs and use OpenAI to summarize and organize the contents of each job posting. This approach helps save time by reducing the need to skim through each posting in detail. As a result, decisions about whether to apply for a job can be made much faster (e.g., 5 seconds versus 30 seconds). However, the output still requires improvement in terms of presentation.
