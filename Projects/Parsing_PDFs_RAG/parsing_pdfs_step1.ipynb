\\ndoctors  may  suffer  from  alcohol  or drug  abuse,  which  \\noften impairs their practice', '  Part o f the problem, he \\nsays, is that health professionals —and physicians \\nespecially —face tremendous stresses trying to \\n“maintain a façade of superiority.”     \\n      Chicago Tribune —July 17, 1987, Reports Say \\nDiagnostic Errors Can Be  Fatal ', 'An article citing an \\nautopsy study involving 32 hospitals around  the country \\nstates that one out of ten hospital deaths may be \\nmisdiagnosed diseases that could have been treated', '\\nThe author of the article concludes that in some small \\nhospitals, the rate of  unnecessary deaths fr om \\nerroneous diagnoses may be more than one in five', ' 515 | P a g e   The report  states  the autopsies,  which  are conducted  \\nto discover the cause of death and the nature of the \\ndisease, showed that  overall there was a major \\ndiscrepancy between the diagnoses before death and  \\nthe autopsy findings afterward in 34% of the  cases', ' \\nDr', 'Robert Anderson, a member of the study team \\nand chief of pathology at the University of New Mexico \\nMedical School, calls these “serious discrepancies.”  \\n“Even more significant is that more than 10 per cent \\nof all autopsies  showed  that a better  diagnosis  might  \\nhave  resulted  in a better outcome,”  he said in a \\ntelephone  interview', ' “If the correct  diagnosis had  been  \\nmade  before  death  and the appropriate  treatment  \\ninstituted, the patient would be  alive.”  \\nThe study also shows that the most commonly \\nmisdiagnosed disorder was blood clots in the lungs, \\nfollowed by infections and bleeding', 'Typical examples \\ninclude diagnosing diverticulitis, a treatable bowel \\ninfection, as an inoperable tumor or misdiagnosing a \\nlung blood clot as a heart attack', ' \\nDr', 'George Lundberg, the Journal editor, said: “The \\nfindings point out a serious crisis in quality assurance in \\nmedicine caused  by a  dramatic  decline  in autopsies,  \\nwhich  has fallen  below  5 percent  in some  hospitals.”  \\nDr', 'Lundberg continues, “I’m very concerned about \\nthe quality of care at any hospital with a very low \\nautopsy rate,” he said, “Less than 20 percent is low and 516 | P a g e   less than 5 percent is abysmally low.”  \\n“They  are missing  diagnoses  often,  and they  don’t  \\neven  seem  to ca re', 'How can they possibly be interested \\nin quality when they aren’t assessing  the quality  of care  \\ngiven  to the people  who  die—their sickest  people?”  \\nThe study  findings,  which  include  2,067  autopsies,  \\nshowed  that small community hospitals, which tend to \\nperform the fewest autopsies, had the highest rates of \\ndiagnostic errors, while university hospitals,  which  do \\nthe most  autopsies,  had the lowest  error  rate', ' \\n   You see that there are a lot of ways to manipulate \\nstatistics', ' \\nAnderson said that among two small hospitals in the \\nstudy that had fewer than 249 beds, there were 71 \\nmajor diagnostic errors, which meant that as many as \\n24 percent of the people who died in those hospitals \\nmight have had their lives prolonged with a proper \\ndiagnosis and subsequent treatme nt', '\\nAnderson  further  states  that,  on the other  hand,  \\namong  five large university hospitals 23% of the cases \\nwere misdiagnosed, which means that only 8% of the \\ndeaths may have been  unnecessary', ' \\n“The  findings  are saying  that medicine  is an inexact  \\nscience  and that we physicians tend to forget that,” he  \\nsaid', ' \\nAutopsies have traditionally served as the last word \\nin determining the cause of death, and the chief means 517 | P a g e   of allowing doctors to learn from their mistakes', '\\nAnderson maintains that the medical profession  has \\nturned away from autopsies in the last two decades', '\\nAnd we all can see why', ' \\n“This is an issue that is a societal concern, not just a \\nmedical concern,” Anderson said', '“We spend  billions of \\ndollars on trying to keep accurate records on what kinds \\nof ill nesses people have  and why they die', 'Obviously, if \\nyou don’t know these records, that’s  not very good.”  \\nAnderson is convinced that one of the prime \\nreasons for the near demise of the autopsy is modern \\nmedical technology', 'Many doctors see such things as \\nCAT scanners and magnetic resonance imaging as a \\nreplacement for the diagnostic accuracy of autopsies, \\nbut they only exchange one type of error for another', ' \\nThe AMA’s  Council  on Scientific  Affairs  came  to the \\nsame  conclusion, and is saying: “With the introduc tion \\nof new technology, the types of errors in diagnosis have \\nshifted, but mistakes continue, practically in complex \\ncases.”  \\nAnderson  says  further  that one could  also conclude  \\nthat the other reasons for the decline of the autopsy are \\ncosts, de -emphasis in medical  school  and fear of \\nmalpractice  suits', ' Many  experts  also place a \\nsignificant share of the blame on the Joint Commission \\non Accreditation of Hospitals that dropped its \\nrecommendation that all hospitals perform a minimum 518 | P a g e   of 20 to 25 % autopsies in 19 70', '\\nCommon sense tells us that there is no way a \\nphysician can be right 100 percent of the time', 'We need \\nthe information on disease and the cause of death, and \\nat the moment we are burying much of that information \\nunderground', ' \\nThe Tribune  article  also stated that in Chicago,  \\nautopsies  plummeted from a high of 51 percent of all \\nhospital deaths in 1965 to 17 percent last year', 'The \\nfigures are similar for the country', 'Of 83 hospitals  in the \\nChicago  area,  57 of them  had an autopsy  rate of less \\nthan 20 percent i n recent years', 'Of these, 37 had \\nautopsy rates below 10 percent, and eight were under 5  \\npercent', ' \\n“The  hospitals  that need  to be worried  about  it the \\nmost  are the ones that have an autopsy rate under 5% \\nand maybe the ones under 10%,” Lundberg said', '“It has \\nto make one worry about how much they care about \\nwhat kind of job they are  doing.”  \\nRightfully fearing that autopsies have been \\nabandoned as a quality control measure, the AMA’s \\npolicy -making House of Delegates  last December  called  \\nfor new  programs  to promo te an increase in the use of \\nautopsies and it endorsed the efforts of the Institute of \\nMedicine to establish a national autopsy  policy', '
